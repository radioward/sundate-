A fast CalDAV client, written in Rust. 

I noticed there's a lack of clean, non-corporate calendar clients, so I decided to make my own. Currently under development. To be available for Linux, Windows and MacOS.      

### Features
- Color coding different calendars
- Searching events
- multiple user accounts
- View and complete tasks separately

### To-do
- [] Basic UI elements
- [] User authentication
- [] Pulling and pushing from CalDAV server
- [] Color coding different calendars
- [] Searching events
- [] multiple user accounts
- [] View and complete tasks in a separate menu
- [] Windows & MacOS support

Suggestions and recommendations for features are welcomed.
